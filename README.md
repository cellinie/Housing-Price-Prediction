# Housing Price Prediction
 
The house_prices.csv file contains the house price dataset for regression. There are 128 samples with 5 features. The following describe the dataset features:
1. SqFt - The area of house (square feet)
2. Bedrooms - The number of bedrooms
3. Bathrooms - The number of bathrooms
4. Neighborhood - The neighborhood where the house is located
5. Price - The price of the house

The goal is to use appropriate attributes in "SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Neighborhood" to predict the attributes "Price".
